# vrc_prefabs
A collection of prefabs and scripts for use in VRChat, created by Poplopo (Marisha Parker).

# Usage
* [Terminal Dialog](https://github.com/intrepidOlivia/vrc_prefabs/blob/master/Terminal%20Dialog%20Tool/Assets/TerminalDialog/readme.md) - A tool for easily generating a terminal-style dialog system (think text-based-game) and setting up all the VRC_Triggers automatically.
* [Slideshow Creator](https://github.com/intrepidOlivia/vrc_prefabs/blob/master/VRC%20Slideshow/Assets/Readme.md) - A slideshow system with built-in remote control. Point the tool at an image directory and the required materials, game objects, and buttons with VRC_Triggers will be automatically generated.
