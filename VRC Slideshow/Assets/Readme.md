made by poplopo

## Use of the Slideshow Creator

Ensure that the [VRCSDK](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/setting-up-the-sdk) is installed in your project.

Drag the Slideshow prefab into your scene.

Open the editor panel for the Slideshow by navigating to Tools > Slideshow Creator.

In the Slideshow Creation editor tab, drag the Slideshow from the scene into the Slideshow Asset variable.

Click the "Select Directory With Images" button and locate the folder that holds all the images you want to bring into the slideshow (file formats jpg, png, tif, bmp, gif).

Materials of these images will be automatically created, and the slideshow in the scene will auto-populate with the images, as well as the remote control buttons and their respective VRC_Triggers

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please feel free to open an issue in the [github](https://github.com/intrepidOlivia/vrc_prefabs) for this project.
